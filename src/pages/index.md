        Swipe is super-concentrated - even diluted 200 to 1 (light solution),
        it’s effective for many household cleaning jobs.  Introduced as an
        industrial cleaner in the 1950’s, Swipe® got its name when workers began
        swiping it for their own use.

    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
